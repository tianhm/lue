Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to Lue, your terminal-based eBook reader with modular text-to-speech support. This document is designed to let you practice navigating your book while hearing instructions read aloud. 


Chapter 2: Navigation

Now letâ€™s test sentence-level navigation. Press "j" to return to the previous sentence. Press "k" to jump to the next sentence. If you want to jump to the top visible sentence on the screen, press "t" key. Press "h" to go back to the previous paragraph. Press "l" to move to the next paragraph. You can pause and resume the text-to-speech model with "p", Lue remembers exactly where you were.  


Chapter 3: Page and Scroll Controls

You can scroll through the book without losing the highlighted sentence being read. Do that by pressing "i" to move page up, and "m" to move page down. For smaller adjustments, use "u" to scroll up or "n" to scroll down a row. Navigating with these keys, the mouse wheel, or a trackpad automatically switches Lue to manual mode. In this mode, pressing "a", returns you back to the highlighted sentence and reactivates auto-scroll mode. Auto-scroll works seamlessly with TTS, keeping your reading flow smooth and uninterrupted. "y" takes you to the beginning, and "b" takes you to the end of the book.


Chapter 4: Mouse Actions

If your terminal supports mouse input, you can click on any sentence to jump to it instantly. Use the mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll through the text, or click on the progress bar to skip directly to that position in the book.


Chapter 5: Speed Adjustment

Lue allows you to adjust the text-to-speech playback speed to match your listening preference. You can increase the speed up to 3x faster. To increase the playback speed, press the period key. Each press will increase the speed incrementally. To decrease the playback speed, press the comma key. Each press will decrease the speed back down to the normal 1x speed.


Chapter 6: Highlighting Controls

There are two levels of text highlighting to help you follow along with the narration: sentence-level highlighting and word-level highlighting. To toggle sentence highlighting on or off, press the "s" key. To toggle word highlighting on or off, press the "w" key. You can use both highlighting modes simultaneously, or disable either one based on your preference.


Chapter 7: Ending the Session

When you are ready to stop reading, press "q" to quit. Your place and your reading mode will be saved automatically, so you can resume later without losing your spot.


Enjoy your reading!
